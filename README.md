**Coding Contest**

This is a framework for publishing artificial, but real life-like problems, which have a mathematical algorithm based solution. Every year a new problem is announced, C# interfaces defined, competitors could provide their implementations. 

The framework loads these solutions as MEF extensions and orders the execution performance either based on time or the score obtained when the code of the competitors are fighting against each-other. 

In order to take part in the competition, share your code somehow with me (best would be single file). Could be mail (bigstefi@yahoo.com) or Git location. I will compile it and run the contest. Binaries will be cut by the mailing system of my company. 
I could run the binaries on my private laptop, but the results would not be comparable with the contest executed within the company on more powerful machines.

Can share the results either here in Git or reply to your mail.
