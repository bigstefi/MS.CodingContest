**Coding Contest**

This is a framework for publishing artificial, but real life-like problems, which have a mathematical algorithm based solution. Every year a new problem is announced, C# interfaces defined, competitors could provide their implementations. 

The framework loads these solutions as MEF extensions and orders the execution performance either based on time or the score obtained when the code of the competitors are fighting against each-other.
